# Metrics Dataset Creation - Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem

You reported that the metrics dataset was not being created when running evaluations, even though the implementation was supposedly complete.

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Missing OpenTelemetry Attributes
**Symptom**: `AttributeError: 'InMemoryMetricExporter' object has no attribute '_preferred_temporality'`

**Cause**: The custom `InMemoryMetricExporter` was missing required attributes that `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` expects.

**Fix**: Added `_preferred_temporality` and `_preferred_aggregation` attributes to the exporter class.

### Issue #2: Empty ResourceMetrics Prevented Dataset Creation
**Symptom**: Metrics dataset not created for API model evaluations (or any evaluation where GPU metrics were empty).

**Cause**: The condition in `push_results_to_hf` was:
```python
if metric_data.get("resourceMetrics"):  # Empty list [] is falsy!
```

This meant that even though `extract_metrics` correctly returned:
```python
{
    "run_id": "abc-123",
    "resourceMetrics": [],  # Empty for API models
    "aggregates": []
}
```

The dataset was never created because an empty list `[]` evaluates to `False` in Python.

**Fix**: Changed the condition to check for key existence:
```python
if "resourceMetrics" in metric_data:  # Checks if key exists, not if truthy
```

## What You'll See Now

### During Evaluation

You'll see detailed debug output like this:

```
[extract_metrics] Starting metric extraction for run_id: abc-123
[extract_metrics] metric_exporter present: True
[extract_metrics] trace_aggregator present: True
[Metrics] No GPU metrics collected (empty list - likely API model)
[Metrics] Aggregated 5 trace metrics
[extract_metrics] Final metrics_dict structure:
  - run_id: abc-123
  - resourceMetrics: 0 batches
  - aggregates: 5 metrics
```

### When Pushing to HuggingFace

**For API Models (no GPU):**
```
[OK] Pushed empty metrics dataset (API model, run_id: abc-123) to username/smoltrace-metrics-...
```

**For GPU Models:**
```
[OK] Pushed 12 GPU metric batches (run_id: xyz-789) to username/smoltrace-metrics-...
```

## Dataset Structure

### API Model Metrics Dataset
```json
{
  "run_id": "abc-123",
  "resourceMetrics": []
}
```

### GPU Model Metrics Dataset
```json
{
  "run_id": "xyz-789",
  "resourceMetrics": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "attributes": [
          {"key": "service.name", "value": {"stringValue": "smoltrace-eval"}},
          {"key": "run.id", "value": {"stringValue": "xyz-789"}}
        ]
      },
      "scopeMetrics": [
        {
          "scope": {"name": "genai.gpu"},
          "metrics": [
            {
              "name": "gen_ai.gpu.utilization",
              "unit": "%",
              "gauge": {
                "dataPoints": [
                  {
                    "timeUnixNano": "1729747217774556600",
                    "asInt": "67"
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

Run your evaluation again and you should now see:

1. **Three datasets created** for every evaluation:
   - Results dataset: `username/smoltrace-results-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
   - Traces dataset: `username/smoltrace-traces-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
   - **Metrics dataset: `username/smoltrace-metrics-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`** ✅

2. **Debug output** showing metric extraction process

3. **Clear messaging** about whether GPU metrics were collected or not

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run a simple evaluation
export HF_TOKEN=your_token
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

smoltrace-eval \
  --model openai/gpt-3.5-turbo \
  --provider litellm \
  --agent-type tool \
  --difficulty easy \
  --enable-otel \
  --run-id test-metrics-fix \
  --output-format hub

# Check that all 3 datasets were created on HuggingFace
# Visit: https://huggingface.co/datasets?search=smoltrace-metrics
```

## Files Modified

1. **smoltrace/otel.py** (lines 138-153)
   - Added `_preferred_temporality` attribute
   - Added `_preferred_aggregation` attribute

2. **smoltrace/utils.py** (lines 377-400)
   - Fixed condition to check key existence
   - Added informative logging

3. **smoltrace/core.py** (lines 568-614)
   - Added comprehensive debug logging

4. **tests/test_otel_fix.py** (new)
   - Tests OTEL setup works correctly

5. **tests/test_metrics_dataset_creation.py** (new)
   - Tests metrics dataset creation logic

6. **IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md**
   - Documented both fixes

## Summary

✅ **Issue Fixed**: Metrics dataset will now be created for ALL evaluations
✅ **API Models**: Dataset created with empty resourceMetrics
✅ **GPU Models**: Dataset created with time-series GPU data
✅ **Debug Logging**: Clear visibility into what's happening
✅ **Tests Added**: Verification tests for both fixes

The implementation is now truly complete and tested!
